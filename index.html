				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>
				The American Civil War was a war fought between the parties of the same nation; the North and the South. When Abraham 	Lincoln was elected president, many southern states succeeded from the Union to form the Confederate States of America. They soon went to war with the North. The war lasted four years starting in 1861 and ending in 1865. The conclusion of the war was quickly followed by a series of constitutional amendments called the Reconstruction Acts. These were amendments 14 and 15.
